        <li>1-1/2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>4 rip bananas, mashed</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>4 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 TBsp milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by heating the oven to 375F. Grease and flour a 15x10-inch jelly roll pan.</li>
        <li>Now the Brownies, in a large bowl, beat together the sugar, sour cream, butter, and eggs 
            until creamy. Blend in the mashed bananas and vanilla extract. 
        </li>
        <li>Then add the flour,baking soda, salt to the bowl. Blend everything for 1 minute. 
            stir in the chopped walnuts.
        </li>
        <li>Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until it turns 
            golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, for the frosting, heat 1/2 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until
            it starts boiling. Let the butter turn a delicate brown then remove it from the heat immediately.
        </li>
        <li>Add the powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and milk to the browned butter. Whisk it all together untill
            smooth. The consistency should be thicker than a glaze but thinner than frosting.
        </li>
        <li>Using a spatula, spread the brown butter frosting over the warm bars. It's easier to spread the 
            frosting while the bars are still warm.
        </li>
    </ol>
